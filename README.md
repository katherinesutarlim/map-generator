# [Map Generator](https://katherinesutarlim.github.io/map-generator/)

This React application will help turn a collection of strewn about cells in a grid into something that could look like a world map. The application is intended to help with world building. You can create a base of what your world could look like, which you can then add to (throw about some rivers, mountains, hills, hey it's your world so the sky is the limit!).

## How to use
The application is available online [here](https://katherinesutarlim.github.io/map-generator/). Here's how to use it.
#### 1. Draw on the grid
Click on a cell or hold and move the cursor across the grid to draw. When you draw on a cell, white cells will turn red and red cells will turn white. Go rogue with your drawing, it may lead to some interesting geography on your map.
#### 2. Dilate
Once you've splattered about the grid, click dilate. Your drawing will be randomly dilated at places, forming a 'land mass' around and about.
#### 3. Repeat
Draw and dilate as you please until you have enough 'continents' and 'islands' for your world-building needs.
